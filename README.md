This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in VBScript related to the unexpected behavior of the `IsEmpty` function when used with numeric variables.  The `IsEmpty` function is designed to check if a variable is uninitialized or contains a null value. However, in VBScript, it doesn't always accurately reflect the state of numeric variables that have not been explicitly assigned a value. The bug and its solution are presented via VBScript code examples.
